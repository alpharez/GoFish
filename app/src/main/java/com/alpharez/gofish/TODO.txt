## Official Rules

### Object
To collect the most sets of 4 cards.

### Setup
Shuffle the cards and deal 7 cards face down to each player. Deal 5 cards to each player if there
are 4 or more players. Place the remaining cards face down in a draw pile where everyone can reach
them. Arrange cards by number so that all the 1s are together, all the 2s are together, and so on.

### The Play
The player to the left of the dealer goes first and play continues clockwise. The first player asks
a specific person if he or she has any cards of a specific number. For example, player one might ask
player three if she has any 2s. Player one must have at least one 2 in his hand in order to ask for
it. If player three has any 2s, she must give them all to player one. Player one may then go again
and can continue playing until he does not get the card he asks for.

If player three does not have any 2s, she says “Go fish!” and player one must take 1 card from the
draw pile. If the picked card is the card he wanted, a 2, he must show it to all players and can
then go again. If it is not the card he asked for, then it is the next person’s turn. Once a player
has collected 4 of a kind, he places the cards in front him. The game ends when either someone has
no cards in his hand or the draw pile runs out.

###Game End
The winner is the person who has collected the most sets of 4 cards. For a simpler version, collect
pairs rather than 4 of a kind. Game plays and ends in the same manner as the standard game.
